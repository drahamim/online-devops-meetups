# online-devops-meetups

Online devops meetups. This is for events like [CoffeeOps](https://www.coffeeops.org/) or similar community-driven events. If your event charges for attendance, it doesn't belong here.

I'm organizing these by time zone, but am open to better suggestions.

## US time zone events

## Europe/Africa time zone events

## Asia time zone events
