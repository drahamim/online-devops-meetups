# online-devops-meetups

Online devops meetups. This is for events like [CoffeeOps](https://www.coffeeops.org/) or similar community-driven events. If your event charges for attendance, it doesn't belong here.

I'm organizing these by time zone, but am open to better suggestions.

## US time zone events

### CoffeeOps online

This takes place on Thursday mornings at 8am MDT (1400 in the one true time zone, UTC). Details are posted in `#coffeeops-online` on the [hangops slack](https://hangops.slack.com/) and in `#remote` in the [coffeeops slack](https://coffeeops.slack.com). Not posting meet links publicly because of drivebys.

### Ops Virtual Happy Hour
