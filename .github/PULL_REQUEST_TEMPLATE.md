Given the very real possibility of internet trolls crashing your meeting and bombing it with abusive content, it is ok (and even encouraged) to not include a meeting link here as long as you post a link to where to find it, or who to contact to get a calendar invite to your meeting.

# Checklist

- [ ] The meeting I'm posting is free of charge to attendees.
- [ ] I included a UTC time to make it easier for people in other time zones to attend.
- [ ] I put the meetup entry in the appropriate time zone section for its home time zone.
- [ ] If my meeting is recurring, I included that in its description.
- [ ] This is not a new meeting, just text corrections.

Thanks!
