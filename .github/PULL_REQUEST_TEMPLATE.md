# Checklist

[ ] The meeting I'm posting is free of charge to attendees.
[ ] I included a UTC time to make it easier for people in other time zones to attend.
[ ] I put my meetup in the appropriate time zone section for its home time zone.
[ ] If my meeting is recurring, I included that in its description.

Thanks!
